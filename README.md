# Toomato Food Delivery Website 🍅🍕

Hi Everyone! 👋

I’m really excited to share my latest project—**Toomato Food Delivery Website** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)! 
🍅🍕 I’ve put in **two months of hard work** to build this, and I’m super proud of the result.

💡 **Main Features**:
- Built with the full **MERN stack** to handle everything from the frontend to the backend 🌐.
- Integrated **Stripe** for secure and smooth online payments 💳.
- Fully responsive, so it works perfectly on phones, tablets, and computers 📱💻.
- Simple and clean design, making it easy for users to browse and order their favorite food 🍽️.

This project has been a great learning experience, and although it had its challenges, I loved every bit of the journey. I’m really proud of how it turned out!

Feel free to check it out, and I’d love to hear your feedback! 😊
